# Shruti Automation Crawler 

Project Automation

  This tool is used to gather information from different sources such as subdomains, urls and from dorks for finding sensitive files also.
  
  After finding all the information about subdomains it will start gathering information about urls and what type of files are there inside it.
  
  After gathering urls it starts fuzzing for the vulnerabilities with the help of cves and some signatures.  
  
  Also it finds the information about hidden directories by dictionary based attack.


#Use
